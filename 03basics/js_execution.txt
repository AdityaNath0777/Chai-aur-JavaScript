whenerver we run a JS file
first it will make Global EC
1) Global Execution context
        assigned 'this',
        Browser, node, bun have their own different object
        i.e. diff environment -> diff context

        // whether they have some value of not

* JS is single threaded -> everything is a process     

2) Function Execution Context
3) Eval Execution Context

A JS code runs in phases

1) Memory Creation phase (or just Creation phase), 
        // resrc allocation for variables

2) Execution Phase

        for e.g. we have a JS code

        let val1 = 10
        let val2 = 8
        function addNum(num1, num2){
                let total = num1 + num2;
                return total;
        }

        let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
        let result2 = addNum(10, 6)


// first cycle
Step 1) Global EC -> allocated in this

Step 2) Memory Phase -> val1 <- undefined
                        val2 <- undefined
                        addNum <- fn definition
                        result1 <- undefined
                        result2 <- undefined

// second cycle
Step 3) Execution Phase
        val1 <- 10
        val2 <- 8
        addNum -> makes it's own EC (exec context)
        // new Executional context created
        // everytime a function is executed // sandbox
